## AWS S3

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building block of AWS
- It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage

- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well

### Amazon S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes and Big data analysis
- Software delivery
- Static website

### Amazon S3 - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects(files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name(across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase, No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter and number
  - Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
  - Must NOT end wih suffix -s3alias

### Amazon S3 - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key
- The KEY is the full path:
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of prefix + object name
  - s3://my-bucket/[my_folder/another_folder]->(prefix)/[my_file.txt](object name)
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets
  (altough the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
  ( Just keys with very long names that contanin slashes("/")

### Amazon S3 - Objects (cont.)

- Object values are content of the body:
  - Max. Object Size is 5TB(5000GB)
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key/ value pair -upto 10) - useful for security /lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## S3 Hands On

### Amazon S3 - Security

- User-Based
  - IMA policies - Which API calls shoudl be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource - Based
  _ Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  _ Object Access Control List(ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
  _ Bucket Access Control List(ACL) - less common ( can be disabled)
  ( Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  _ The user IAM permission ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it \* AND there's no explicit DENY
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

### S3 Bucket Policies

##########################75##########SS#########2.45

- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Effect: Allow/ Deny
  - Actions: Set of API to allow or Deny
  - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:

  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

- Example

## Hands on Bucket policy

### Amazon S3 - Static Website Hosting

- S3 can host static websties and have them accessible on the Internet
- The website URL will be (depending on the region)

## Hands on Website

### Amazon S3 - Versioning

- you can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the "version":1,2,3....
- It is beset practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy rollback to previous version
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

### Amazon S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- CRR - Cross-Region-Replication (CRR)
- SRR - Same-Region-Replication (SSR)

* Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
* Copying is asynchronous
* Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

* Use cases:
	* CRR - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
	* SRR - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts


### S3 Storage Classes

* Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
* Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA) 
* Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
* Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 
* Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
* Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
* Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

* Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

#### Durability and Availability
* Durability:
	* High durability(99.99999%) of objects across multiple AZ
	* If you store !00,000,00 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
	* Same for all storage classes

* Availability:
	* Measures how readily available a service is
	* Varies depending on storage class
	* Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year

#### 1. S3 Standard - General Purpose
* 99.99% Availability
* Used for frequently accessed data
* Low latency and high throughput
* Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures

* Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution...

#### 2. S3 Storage Classes - Infrequency Access
* For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
* Lower cost than S3 Standard

* Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	* 99.9% Availability
	* Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups
* Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access(S3 One Zon-IA)
	* High durability (99.99999%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed 
	* 99.5% Availability
	* Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

#### 3. Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
* Low-cost object storage meant for archieving/backup
* Pricing: price for stoage + object retrieval cost

#### 4. Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
	* Millisecond retrival, great for data accessed once a quarter 
	* Minimum storage duration of 90 days
#### 5. Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier):
	* Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to hours), Bulk(5 to 12 hours) - free
#### 6. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive - for long term storage:
	* Standard(12 hours), Bulk(48 hors)
	* Minimum storage duration of 180 days
#### 7. S3 Intelligent - Tiering
	* Small montly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
	* Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
	* There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering

	*Frequent Access tier(automatic):default tier
	* Infrequent Access tier(automatic): object not accessed for 30 days
	* Archive Instant Access tier(automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
	* Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700_ days
	* Deep Archive Access tier(optional): config from 180 days to 700+ days
